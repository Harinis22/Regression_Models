# Regression_Models
Machine Learning Models Project
Overview
This project contains two Jupyter notebooks demonstrating foundational machine learning techniques:

Linear Regression: An implementation and explanation of linear regression used to predict continuous outcomes.
Logistic Regression: An implementation of logistic regression used to predict binary outcomes.
Prerequisites
Python 3.9+
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Dependencies
To run the notebooks, you need to install the following Python libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
You can install these dependencies via pip:

Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Installation
To use these notebooks:

Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
Ensure that you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. If not, you can install it via pip:
Copy code
pip install notebook
Navigate to the directory containing the notebooks and launch Jupyter Notebook:
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Usage
Open the desired notebook in Jupyter:

For a walkthrough of linear regression, open Linear Regression.ipynb.
For logistic regression, open logisticRegression.ipynb.
Each cell in the notebooks can be run sequentially to understand the process and results of the models.
